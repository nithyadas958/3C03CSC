      <h4>Bekal Fort was built by Shivappa Nayaka of Keladi in 1650 AD, at Bekal.it is the largest fort in Kerala. It has a beautiful water tank with flights of stairs running down to it, an observation tower and numerous peepholes offering picturesque views of the surrounding valley. There is an ancient Anjaneya Temple, a mosque, a sea bastion and several underground passages. To one side lies a shallow beach. The zigzag entrance added to the defence strategy of the fort.

There are a number of nearby attractions one can go to. The Bekal Hole Aqua Park is a small pier with pedal boats and water cycles on offer. A 10-min drive away, Kappil Beach offers seclusion and casuarinas. The Kodi Cliff is worth the climb for the views. The 17th-century Chandragiri Fort, 4 km away, yields great views from atop.</h4>
