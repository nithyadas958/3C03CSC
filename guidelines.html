    Bekal Beach is one of the cleanest beaches
of Kerala. It is located&nbsp;in Kasaragod
district of Kerala and is around 4km from
the national highway.&nbsp;The water here
is quite pleasant, where you can have a
swim(safe for children as well). Walking
along the seashore you will find&nbsp;all
sorts of amazing shells. The beach is in
a&nbsp;shape of a semi-circle&nbsp;fringed
with coconut&nbsp;trees along its borders.
You can enjoy&nbsp;local food, drinks and
camel rides on the beach. Bekal Beach
is&nbsp;relatively less known among
tourists, which is why it remains less
crowded and clean. You can sit peacefully
and enjoy the views of waves thumping
against the walls of fort.
